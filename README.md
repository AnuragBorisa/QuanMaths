# QuanMaths
Welcome to **QuanMaths** – my personal playground for coding up the math behind Quantum Variational Algorithms (VQAs). If you’ve ever wondered what it takes to turn linear algebra, probability and complex numbers into working quantum code, you’ve come to the right place.

## Why This Repo Exists

I’m on a journey to really **understand** the mathematics that power VQAs, not just by reading equations but by **programming** them. Every folder in here represents a chunk of math I’ve wrestled with, coded up, and tested. My hope is that by sharing my experiments and exercises, anyone else curious about the nuts and bolts of VQAs can follow along — or even spot bugs in my logic!

Happy learning and happy coding!
